# HOW TO INSTALL PROJECT

Ensure that you have node, git, npm or yarn installed.

Type in command line, or terminal

in windows search cmd or powershell in search bar, in linux use terminal

> node --version
>
> git --version
>
> npm --version
>or
> yarn --version

If one of those conditions aren't meet then:

#1 Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from here

#2 Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) from here

#3 Npm comes with node, but yarn need to be enabled for use.

for installing yarn check above command node --version

>for node.js >=16.10
>
>Corepack is included by default with all Node.js installs, but is >currently opt-in. To enable it, run the following command in terminal or cmd:
>
>corepack enable


> for Node.js <16.10
>
>Corepack isn't included with Node.js in versions before the 16.10; to address that, run:
>
>npm i -g corepack

Now you should have prerequisites installed.
